why is git around?
git is version control system.

Remote origin
server that saves our codes
so that different persons can pull our code.
git push : sending code to internet
git pull : recieving the code from internet.

->Helps to keep track of the changes(versions).
->easily recover files.
->Who introduced a issue and when.
->roll back to previously working state.

history
-------
1. local VCS : the changes remain in the local computer(hard disk).
   If the pc got damaged then all the data will be lost.
   advn : you can roll back.
2. Centralised VCS : There is a server. Many people can collaborate they pull files
   after finishing they push the project. The server is the master, the copy on the
   centralised server is the final copy of the project.
   files can be recovered from centralised server.
   disadvn : if the server got damaged the data will be lost. But there is copy
   of the data is there with user so less data will get lost.
3. Distributed VCS : There is a centralised server and many people are collaborating
   here the history of the files is there with every user.(full repository)
   There is whole backup with the users. so dependency on server is less.
   Here after so many changes the size of the repository will increased. so we want
   that size to increase a least.
   Ex : Git

How was git created ?
1991 - 2002 : development of linux
In 2002, developers of linux operating system realised the importance of VCS
In, 2002 the started using the bitkeeper named VCS. There is no git at that time.
2005 : controversy happens the owners of bitkeeper said now bitkeeper cannot be free
there are charges on using it.
so linus storevald developed git.

github : manages git repository.
gitlab, bitbucket is like github.
they are used for hosting git projects.

Features of Git:
1. Captures the snapshot not differences.
.git folder : history of project(hidden folder)
we can get the particular version.
2. Almost every operation is local(no need of internet)
you dont need to push in any server.
Just when you feel now my work is complete you can push the files in github(remote
repository).
3. git has integrity.
it is not like that if any random person makes some changes and they get reflected on
the your repository.
here git finds the SHA 1-check sum of all the changes.
SHA 1-check sum : if some minute change has been made on the fils it will be changed
if the check sum is same so it is not changed.
integrity means no one can change the files. if someone changes then git will let know
about the changes.
4. git generally adds data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git bash / powershell is a terminal matches with linux
git bash takes linux type path.

commands :
-->git

-->pwd : present working directory

-->cd 
   
-->git config --global user.name "sakshi" user.email "tiwarisakshi1302@gmail.com"
   defines user of the project and the changes will be reflected by your name.

-->git congig username
   we can check the username over here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you made a folder and there are several files there.
you made a version 1 that is perfectly working.
Then you made snapshot and saves the moment.
commit 1 : working v1
Then you changed some files in the folder. But there is one file there come some 
errors but other files are working.
commit 2 :so you want that in new snapshot you take new files that are working fine and 
the old file of the file that got some error.

To solve this problem the three stage architecture of git is made.
we have three types of areas.
1. working directory : files that are seen in windows.
from this area we put some files in the stagging area.
2. stagging area : files that you want to go to new commit.
If you dont want to put some files in next commit so dont put that files in stagging
area
3. git directory(repository) : .git folder contain the compressed data
git takes the reponsiblity of putting the the files that you want in the working
directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->git status : Shows if this folder is already a git repository or not.

-->git init : initialised a new empty git repo.
means the folder has been made a git repository.
now git tracks the repo.

branch is by default : master (main branch)

-->git add --a : all files will be sent to stagging area.(or -->git add.)

-->git add "file1" : file1 will be send to stagging area.

now after commiting there comes a snapshot of the files.

-->git commit --m "message" : commit the files in the stagging area.

-->git log : tells all the commits you made.

-->git clone repo link : command for cloning the repository
   ssh link for remote repository 
   https link for simply add all data of repo to your repo
if you need new folder for this repository then use . at the last

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a part of software the log gets generated, but we dont have any benefit 
from it so we want to ignore it.
so we can make a .gitignore file inside our folder.

If we add error.log file inside .gitignore file it will not be tracked
it will be ignored.

If we change something in error.log it will not been shown in git bash.

-If we write *.log inside the gitignore file all the log files will be ignored.

-If we write dir/ inside the gitignore the dir folder will not be tracked.
Thios will ignore all dir folder.

-If we want to ignore the outer dir folder write /dir/ inside the .gitignore.

-If we want to ignore static/dir then write static/dir inside .gitignore.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we modify a file and add in stagging area using git add command then
it will seen as modified as well as to be commit by using git status command.

git diff compares the working directory with the stagging area.


HP@DESKTOP-C4K41EU MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Git Hub (master)
$ git add .

HP@DESKTOP-C4K41EU MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Git Hub (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   Git Basics.txt
        new file:   new.txt


HP@DESKTOP-C4K41EU MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Git Hub (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   Git Basics.txt
        new file:   new.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   new.txt


HP@DESKTOP-C4K41EU MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Git Hub (master)
$ git diff
diff --git a/new.txt b/new.txt
index 4011030..9499799 100644
--- a/new.txt

-sakshi

--> git diff --staged : compares the previous commit with the present stagging 
area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ignoring the stagging area 

-->git commit -a -m "Direct commit"

By using this command there is no need to use the add and commit command 
seperately.
But the untracked file do not go in commit.
You need to seperately add the untracked file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving and Renaming the git files.

If you rename certain tracked ex new.txt to new1.txt file git will say that you have deleted 
new.txt and made new file new1.txt.
but if we add the file in stagging area then git will know the file is renamed.

-->git rm new.txt : Removing third new.txt file and it will be automatically stagged.

-->git mv new.txt new1.txt : Rename the new.txt to new1.txt and the it will be automatically stagged.

If we tarcking some files for some time but now we want to add the file in gitignore
to ignore it. So we add it in .gitignore but here git will continue tracking
till we explicitly untrack the file.
-->git rm --cached new.txt
Now for git new.txt is deleted but it will remain in our working tree.
But we have putted the file in gitignore it will not be seen as untracked.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to view the commits?
-->git log

-->git log -p : this will show the changes in the particular files also.

-->git log -p -n : this will show the n initial commits along with their diff

-->git log --stat : short summary of the commits

-->git log --pretty=short : 1 commit in 1 line

-->git log --since=2.days : commits since 2 days

-->git log --since=2.weeks : commits since 2 weeks

-->git log --pretty=format"%h -- %ae" 

Merging the changes in the previous commits
-->git commit --amend
press i for changing things
press esc then wq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unstagging the files

-->git restore --staged file_name

If we have deleted some info that we needed so want to unmodify the changes and go to 
previous commit

-->git checkout -- file_name

-->git checkout -f : all the files will be changed same a previous commit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-->git remote add origin https://github.com/tiwarisakhi1302/Java-Script-Projects.git

git remote add klrdo ek url ko jiska naam origin ha

origin is name of the url

url shows the website where our repository is there

-->git remote : tells about all the remotes

-->git remote -v : links for pushing and pulling

-->git push -u origin master : 
This will show a error as permission denied. If you have the permission then anyone can change
the repo.
so add a ssh key : 

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
press enter till the command is over.
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
$ tail ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
$ tail ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
This command will generate the key
Paste the key in the ssh key

Then the key will be generated.

Now If you want to make a new Repository

$ echo "# Java-Script-Projects" >> README.md
$ git init
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:tiwarisakhi1302/Java-Script-Projects.git
$ git branch -M main
$ git push origin main

If you have add new files in the folder ex new.txt and wanted to add this file in remote
repo
$ git add "new.txt"
$ git commit --m "commit 1"
$ git push origin main

Then the file will be added to repository

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git alias

alias : nickname to the command

$ git config --global alias.st status

$ git st
This command will be same as git status
