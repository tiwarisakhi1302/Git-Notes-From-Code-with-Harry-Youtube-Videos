why is git around?
git is version control system.

Remote origin
server that saves our codes
so that different persons can pull our code.
git push : sending code to internet
git pull : recieving the code from internet.

->Helps to keep track of the changes(versions).
->easily recover files.
->Who introduced a issue and when.
->roll back to previously working state.

history
-------
1. local VCS : the changes remain in the local computer(hard disk).
   If the pc got damaged then all the data will be lost.
   advn : you can roll back.
2. Centralised VCS : There is a server. Many people can collaborate they pull files
   after finishing they push the project. The server is the master, the copy on the
   centralised server is the final copy of the project.
   files can be recovered from centralised server.
   disadvn : if the server got damaged the data will be lost. But there is copy
   of the data is there with user so less data will get lost.
3. Distributed VCS : There is a centralised server and many people are collaborating
   here the history of the files is there with every user.(full repository)
   There is whole backup with the users. so dependency on server is less.
   Here after so many changes the size of the repository will increased. so we want
   that size to increase a least.
   Ex : Git

How was git created ?
1991 - 2002 : development of linux
In 2002, developers of linux operating system realised the importance of VCS
In, 2002 the started using the bitkeeper named VCS. There is no git at that time.
2005 : controversy happens the owners of bitkeeper said now bitkeeper cannot be free
there are charges on using it.
so linus storevald developed git.

github : manages git repository.
gitlab, bitbucket is like github.
they are used for hosting git projects.

Features of Git:
1. Captures the snapshot not differences.
.git folder : history of project(hidden folder)
we can get the particular version.
2. Almost every operation is local(no need of internet)
you dont need to push in any server.
Just when you feel now my work is complete you can push the files in github(remote
repository).
3. git has integrity.
it is not like that if any random person makes some changes and they get reflected on
the your repository.
here git finds the SHA 1-check sum of all the changes.
SHA 1-check sum : if some minute change has been made on the fils it will be changed
if the check sum is same so it is not changed.
integrity means no one can change the files. if someone changes then git will let know
about the changes.
4. git generally adds data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git bash / powershell is a terminal matches with linux
git bash takes linux type path.

commands :
-->git

-->pwd : present working directory

-->cd 
   
-->git config --global user.name "sakshi" user.email "tiwarisakshi1302@gmail.com"
   defines user of the project and the changes will be reflected by your name.

-->git congig username
   we can check the username over here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you made a folder and there are several files there.
you made a version 1 that is perfectly working.
Then you made snapshot and saves the moment.
commit 1 : working v1
Then you changed some files in the folder. But there is one file there come some 
errors but other files are working.
commit 2 :so you want that in new snapshot you take new files that are working fine and 
the old file of the file that got some error.

To solve this problem the three stage architecture of git is made.
we have three types of areas.
1. working directory : files that are seen in windows.
from this area we put some files in the stagging area.
2. stagging area : files that you want to go to new commit.
If you dont want to put some files in next commit so dont put that files in stagging
area
3. git directory(repository) : .git folder contain the compressed data
git takes the reponsiblity of putting the the files that you want in the working
directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->git status : 

-->git init : initialised a new empty git repo.
means the folder has been made a git repository.
now git tracks the repo.

branch is by default : master (main branch)

-->git add --a : all files will be sent to stagging area.

now after commiting there comes a snapshot of the files.

-->git commit --m "message" : commit the files in the stagging area.

-->git log : tells all the commits you made.
